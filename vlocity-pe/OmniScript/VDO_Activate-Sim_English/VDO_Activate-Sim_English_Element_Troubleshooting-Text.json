This is the case even if you no longer have service through your cellular carrier. Just insert any supported SIM card, and you should be able to get around activation errors that say you need a SIM card.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<p><strong>Reseat the SIM card</strong> &ndash; Sometimes reseating the SIM card is necessary. You might see a NO SIM error even though you have a SIM card installed, and that could be because it&rsquo;s not sitting in the SIM card tray correctly, making it impossible for your iPhone to read it. Eject the tray with a paperclip or SIM eject tool, reseat the SIM card on the tray, and re-insert it.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<p><strong>Sign in with your Apple ID</strong> &ndash; In some cases, you need to sign in with your Apple ID to activate your iPhone. This is because later versions of iOS include a feature called Activation Lock, and it protects your device from being restored and used by someone else in the chance that it&rsquo;s stolen.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<p><strong>Make sure Apple&rsquo;s activation server is online</strong> &ndash; As we said earlier, sometimes Apple&rsquo;s servers get slammed and it can cause high volumes of activation traffic that the servers just can&rsquo;t handle. In these cases, activation may be slow or non-existent. You can check Apple&rsquo;s System Status page to see if the activation server is down, and if it is, try again later.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<p><strong>Connect to a Wi-Fi network</strong> &ndash; In some cases, the cellular signal may not be strong enough to activate the iPhone. Since you need an internet connection to reach Apple&rsquo;s activation servers, you may need to connect to a Wi-Fi network, which should be more reliable.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<p><strong>Connect your iPhone to iTunes</strong> &ndash; If no Wi-Fi networks are around, and you don&rsquo;t have cellular service, connect to iTunes on a trusted computer and activate your iPhone that way. iTunes has an activation mechanism built into it that can reach Apple&rsquo;s activation servers directly with an internet connection.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<p><strong>Make sure iTunes is up to date</strong> &ndash; If you are using iTunes to activate your iPhone, and it&rsquo;s not working, ensure you have the latest version installed. Having an outdated version of iTunes could prevent you from activating your iPhone, as some versions of iTunes don&rsquo;t support the latest iOS devices on the market.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<p><strong>Restart the iPhone</strong> &ndash; Sometimes the problem is a fluke with iOS itself, and restarting your iPhone and starting over can resolve the problem.</p>\n<p><strong>Restore your iPhone</strong> &ndash; If you suspect your problem has something to do with your firmware being out of date, you can always restore and update your iPhone to the latest version in iTunes using Recovery Mode. I would only suggest this option if all of the above haven&rsquo;t worked for you yet.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<p><strong>Contact us</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; It is very possible, and not too uncommon, that the carrier you bought your iPhone from gave you a bad SIM card, or that your SIM card is damaged. Try contacting your carrier to see if you can get a replacement SIM card. You typically have to pay a very small fee to get a new one, but not all carriers charge you for a replacement. Mileage varies.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<p><strong>Contact Apple</strong> &ndash; If absolutely nothing is working, and you swear you&rsquo;re not an iPhone thief trying to break into a stolen iPhone, you should contact Apple directly. It could be a hardware malfunction in the device itself that is preventing the iPhone from reading the SIM card. Apple may replace the iPhone if you schedule a Genius Bar appointment.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<p></p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"grid2col\"></section>\n</section>"
